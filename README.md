# Basic-Python-Code
This project contains beginner-level Python programs solving tasks like printing formats, unit conversions, arithmetic operations, and basic mathematical problems.
These exercises are designed to build strong fundamentals in Python â€” a critical skill for diving into Machine Learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI).

âœ¨ Covers real-world inspired problems like Euclidean Distance, Sum of Squares, and Heads & Legs puzzles.

ðŸ”¥ Strengthens core logic, input/output handling, and mathematical operations.

ðŸ“š Forms the foundation for advanced AI topics like data preprocessing, distance-based algorithms (e.g., KNN), and feature engineering.
